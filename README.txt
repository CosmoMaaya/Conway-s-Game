There are three modes in this application: running, manual and drawing.

Upon starting, the application is in running mode. Users can click any built-in shape button, and then click at a certain
place on board to draw that shape. Notice that user can only draw one shape once at a time. That is to say, if user wants
to generate two blocks, he must click block button, click some place on canvas, and click the block button again, then
click on canvas again.

As long as the game is paused, we are in manual mode. You can achieve this simply by clicking the Pause button. Then you
can click NextFrame button to do a single step.

You can enter drawing mode anytime by clicking the Draw button. Notice that doing this would also compulsorily pause the game,
which also means you can click the NextFrame button to do a single-step. In drawing mode, you can click any cell on board.
You will toggle the status of the cell you click on. i.e. click on a dead cell will make it alive, and vice versa.

You can click the Draw button again to exit drawing mode, but the game would still be paused. If you want to use any built-in
shape in drawing mode, that will also result in exiting of drawing mode.

When the game is paused, you can click Play button to resume its execution. This means if you are currently in drawing mode,
then you will exit it automatically and continue the game. You will also not be able to use NextFrame button unless you
pause the game again.
